    <h1>Privacy Policy for Penny Log App</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the Penny Log mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Privacy Principle: Your Data Remains Under Your Control</h2>
    <p>
        Penny Log is designed as a privacy-focused financial tracking application. Your financial data belongs entirely to you. 
        We do not collect, access, store, transmit, or sell your personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect or have access to any personally identifiable information or financial records entered into the App.
        This includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expense amounts</li>
        <li>Income amounts</li>
        <li>Categories</li>
        <li>Descriptions or notes</li>
        <li>Dates and timestamps</li>
        <li>Split expense participant details and calculations</li>
        <li>Group or shared expense data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All such data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly enable system-level cloud backup.
    </p>

    <h2>Split Expense Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        The Split Expense feature allows you to divide expenses across multiple participants for personal tracking purposes. 
        All calculations and related data remain stored locally on your device. We do not transmit split expense data to our servers 
        and we do not maintain any backend database containing your financial information.
    </p>

    <h2>Google Cloud Backup</h2>
    <p>
        Penny Log supports device-level backup through Google Cloud Backup (Android system backup service).
        If enabled on your device, your app data may be securely backed up to your personal Google account as part of 
        Android’s automatic backup system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Important clarifications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The backup process is managed entirely by the Android operating system.</li>
        <li>Backup data is encrypted and associated with your personal Google account.</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your Google account or backed-up data.</li>
        <li>We cannot view, modify, or delete your cloud backup data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You may manage or disable backups through your device’s system settings.
    </p>

    <h2>How Your Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect user data, your information is used solely within the app for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying expense and income history</li>
        <li>Performing financial calculations and analytics</li>
        <li>Managing split expense calculations</li>
        <li>Allowing you to edit, delete, or organize your entries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        All financial data is stored locally on your mobile device in a secure local database.
        The security of your data depends on your device security measures. We recommend:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using a strong device passcode or biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Keeping your operating system updated</li>
        <li>Managing cloud backup settings according to your preference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share your personal or financial data with any third parties.
        The App does not include third-party analytics SDKs, advertising platforms, or external data tracking services.
        Any cloud backup is handled directly by your device operating system provider (e.g., Google for Android).
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.
        Because we do not collect user data, we do not possess any information related to children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Control and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You have full control over your data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may delete individual entries within the App at any time.</li>
        <li>You may uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.</li>
        <li>You may manage or delete cloud backups via your Google account settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect feature enhancements or regulatory requirements.
        Updates become effective immediately upon posting within the App or on this page.
    </p>
