    <h1>Privacy Policy for Penny Log App</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 7, 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled when you use the Penny Log mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Privacy Principle: Your Data is Your Own</h2>
    <p>
        The Penny Log App is designed to be a private and offline tool for your personal use. Our fundamental privacy principle is that your data is your own. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do **not** collect, store, or have access to any personally identifiable information. All the data you enter into the App, including but not limited to the following, is stored exclusively on your local device: [2]
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expense amounts</li>
        <li>Income amounts</li>
        <li>Categories</li>
        <li>Descriptions</li>
        <li>Dates and timestamps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to it. [2, 9]
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Because we do not collect your information, we do not use it for any purpose other than the core functionality of the App. The data stored locally on your device is used only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your expense and income history to you. [2]</li>
        <li>Calculate totals and provide you with spending analytics. [2]</li>
        <li>Allow you to edit and manage your entries. [2]</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        All your financial data is stored in a local database on your mobile device. [3] We do not use any external servers or cloud storage. Therefore, the security of your data depends on the security of your device. We recommend using a strong passcode and other available security features on your device to protect your information. [3]
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share your data with any third parties because we do not have access to it. [2] The App does not contain any third-party analytics, advertising platforms, or SDKs that would collect your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. [2] We do not knowingly collect any information from children. As we do not collect or store any user data, we would not have any information from children to begin with. [2]
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
